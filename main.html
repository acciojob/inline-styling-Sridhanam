		<p>A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom,[1] is the reproductive 
			structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).
			Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that
			enclose and protect the developing flower. Petals attract pollinators,
			and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering 
			plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are
			enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female
			gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.
			In some plants, multiple flowers occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk)
			, and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle 
			(inflorescence stalk)</p>

		<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa
			(/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the 
			flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of 
			thousands of cultivars.[5] They form a group of plants that can be 
			erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed 
			with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are 
			usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows 
			and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native
			to Europe, North America, and Northwest Africa.[6] Species, cultivars 
			and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant.
			Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants 
			range in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can reach 
			seven meters in height.[6] Different species hybridize easily, and this
			has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.</p>
